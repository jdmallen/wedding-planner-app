# Wedding Planner App

I wrote this to help my fianc√©e and I organize our wedding, though the scope eventually narrowed to a simple app to provide information about our wedding and allow our invitees to easily RSVP paperlessly.

It's written in C# and Javascript using [.NET Core 2.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) and [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) + [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux). I'm using [reactstrap](https://github.com/reactstrap/reactstrap) to style the UI because I [suck at front-end design](https://i.redd.it/u9v1bvq0j6611.jpg). I knew plenty about .NET Core before starting this, but basically nothing about React, Redux, or [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack). As you browse through the code, hopefully you'll gain an appreciation for the crazy things I've figured out along the way.

There are no tests because of my initial resistance to TDD and due to time constraints. I've made a point to eventually put them into the code, as I imagine this app will continue to grow beyond our wedding date in the hopes that others may find it similarly useful.

This references my C# [toolbox](https://github.com/jdmallen/toolbox), which is where I store all my handy abstractions, extensions, utility classes, etc., that I've picked up through my career. Much of the toolbox was born out of this project.

## Server Requirements

* Any Windows or Unix-like machine can run the .NET Core binaries below.
* [.NET Core 2.2 Runtime or SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)* or [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)

_*If you choose to use npm instead of Yarn in a non-development environment, you'll need to modify the pre-build targets in the `WeddingPlanner.Web.csproj` file, which are currently set to yarn. It's just faster for me._

## Get it running

1. Clone this repo and `cd` into the directory.
2. Execute `dotnet run -p WeddingPlanner.Web/`
3. In another terminal, execute `yarn watch` or `npm run watch` from `WeddingPlanner.Web/`.
4. Navigate to http://localhost:5000/*

_*I [originally](https://github.com/jdmallen/wedding-planner-app/blob/477c06fa8fd22f536f002fbe116c75830f209ef6/WeddingPlanner.Web/Program.cs?ts=2#L19) configured Kestrel to [bind to SSL ports with a certificate file (or Windows store cert)](https://github.com/jdmallen/toolbox/blob/master/JDMallen.Toolbox/Extensions/StartupExtensions.cs?ts=2#L30-L128), but it was far too great a hassle. I ended up using nginx as a reverse proxy and configuring SSL there instead, which I found far more convenient. [This is also the prescribed method of hosting .NET Core apps by Microsoft as of 2019-03-23](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/linux-nginx?tabs=aspnetcore2x&view=aspnetcore-2.2)._
